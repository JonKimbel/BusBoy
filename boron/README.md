This directory contains the client code for the Bus Boy, intended for deployment
on a Particle Boron.

The .pb files are compiled protobufs. To change them, change the API definition
in the `/api` directory then compile them by following the instructions in the
[main README](/README.md).

See [the main docs](../docs/index.md) for more info.
