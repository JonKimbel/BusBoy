This directory contains code for Atmel chips that serve as drivers for large LED
panels. These drivers allow the Bus Boy client (a Particle Boron) to display
data on large screens.

Compile and run this code by following the instructions in the
[main README](/README.md).

See [the main docs](../docs/index.md) for more info.
